As a Firefighter/Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), I run into quite a few patients, especially the elderly, who have no idea what medications they take or what their medications actually do. When you hold up a pill bottle and ask the patient about it, they  will say something along the lines of, "I think that one is for my sugar (i.e., diabetes)," or "I felt bad and the doctor gave me this," etc. This lack of knowledge and understanding can obviously be dangerous.. For example, if I hold up a pill bottle labeled Apixaban, known as Eliquis, the patient may say, "That's for my legs." Eliquis is actually an anticoagulant used to treat cardiovascular issues, such as stroke or deep-vein thrombosis (DVT). A patient who has fallen may think they have a simple bruise, but if they are taking Eliquis, the patient may actually "bleed out" internally without realizing it, because anticoagulants keep the blood from clotting normally.

Therefore, I came up with a two-sided, laminated sheet of paper that lists and cross-references the brand name, generic name, and purpose of the top 200 medications that appear on pharmacists' certification tests. The list has worked from day one and has assisted my fellow first responders and I in identifying medications quickly, as well as getting a better picture of a patient's history.

I had wanted to create an electronic version of the list for a while, so I decided to do so as a project to fulfil my undergraduate capstone requirement. This way, I could have the list available on my phone when I entered the patient's home, instead of leaving the sheet in the ambulance. In addition, the electronic version includes more details about the medication, such as side-effects, etc. The project earned me an A and I still use it every shift.

However, I wrote that version in Java Server Pages (JSP), and maintaining a Tomcat or Glassfish server is a pain. Therefore, I've decided to rewrite the application in Xamarin Forms, so it can be ported to Android and iOS. I also decided to share the code with you and I hope it will help you with your own work and projects!
